# Minecraft-3D-Minesweeper
Datapack folder for 3D Minesweeper in Minecraft
Inspired by and partially adapted from [TheAl_T's creation](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/3d-minesweeper-in-minecraft-3298593/)

Most of the code is in [/data/3d_minesweeper/functions](/data/3d_minesweeper/functions)

Todo:
-Reverse hideCount when unflagging
-Change "unless air" to "if stone or redstone block" to make things not break when placing torches
-Survival style game? Dynamic loading and bombs can kill you but dont cause loss condition
